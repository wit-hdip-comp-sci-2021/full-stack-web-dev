### Exercise 1: Input Authenticate Schemas

The authenticate route is not currently available to the Swagger/OpenAPI documentation system.  Try to document the input parameters. This seems fairly straightforward, as we already have **UserCredentialSpec**. This should generate the appropriate documentation - but it will break the tests. See if you can figure out why the tests are breaking (and fix them).

### Exercise 2: Output Authenticate Schemas

This is the structure of successful authentication response:

~~~javascript
          return h.response({ success: true, token: token }).code(201);
~~~

Create an appropriate schema such that this will be documented as a Swagger/OpenAPI response.
