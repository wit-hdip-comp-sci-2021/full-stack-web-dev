# View Application Logs

The logs we are used to viewing on the console can also be accessed on Heroku. In the application folder, enter this command:

```bash
heroku logs --tail
```

As you interact with the app, you should logs something like this:

```bash

```

The error we are looking for is in there:

~~~bash
2022-03-14T13:56:04.247593+00:00 app[web.1]: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/app/.env'
2022-03-14T13:56:04.439210+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Process exited with status 1
2022-03-14T13:56:04.554754+00:00 heroku[web.1]: State changed from starting to crashed
~~~

Our app will exit if we cannot find the .env. As we are setting the variables on the heroku dashboard, perhaps we should let the app run:

### server.js

~~~javascript
const result = dotenv.config();
if (result.error) {
  console.log(result.error.message);
  // process.exit(1);
}
~~~

You will need to commit this change, and then push the new version:

~~~bash
git push heroku master
~~~

This time it should launch successfully:

~~~bash
heroku open
~~~

You may choose to keep an eye on the logs while the app is running:

~~~bash
heroku logs --tail
~~~

It should launch successfully this time - and you should be able to log in and interact with the deployed app.
