# Heroku

The following commands are executed from within the playtime project folder.

Verify that the following command responds with a recent version number:

```bash
heroku --version
```

Now log in to your heroku account:

```bash
heroku login
```

This will open a browser to complete the login - and will report back on the command line that you are logged in successfully.

Now create an application (on Heroku) by entering this command on the console:

```bash
heroku create
```

This will respond with a new name in a few seconds:

```bash
Creating app... â¬¢ calm-brushlands-29225
https://calm-brushlands-29225.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/calm-brushlands-29225.git
```

The two urls reported are the newly created url to access the app on (you will need this in a moment), and also the remote git repository where the source of your pushed to during deployment.

On the web, you can check to see if the app is present on your dashboard:

- <https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps>

Explore the dashboard for the app for a few minutes, examining the various options:

We haven't deployed anything yet however.
