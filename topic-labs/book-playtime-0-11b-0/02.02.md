## Prepare Application for Deployment

We need to make a small change in server.js, changing the way the server is created:

## server.js

This is our current server connection:

```javascript
const server = Hapi.server({
  port: 3000,
  host: 'localhost',
});
```

Change to this:

```javascript
const server = Hapi.server({
  port: process.env.PORT || 3000,
});
```

In order to deploy to Heroku, we will be relying on the app being committed to a git repository. If not committed to a repository, do so now. Make sure the changes we have just made are also committed.
