# Configure Environment Variables

Before deploying the application - we need to revisit our .env file. The latest version is currently not committed (for privacy reasons), but its values are important for the application:

```bash
cookie_name=donation-web
cookie_password=secretpasswordnotrevealedtoanyone
# db=mongodb://localhost/donation
db=mongodb+srv://playtime:playtime@cluster0.rhZZZmAA4m.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Recall, these are loaded when our application starts, and are essential configuration parameters. We are loading these parameters in `index.js` like this:

```javascript
const result = dotenv.config();
if (result.error) {
  console.log(result.error.message);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

The `dotenv` component :

- <https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme>

actually loads the values in the `process.env`, which we then access in our app:

- <https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/process.html#process_process_env>

Heroku provides a way of overriding the behavior of dotenv - allowing the these values to be set in the application settings. Open your application on Heroku:

Go to `Settings`

Select `Reveal Config Vars` - and add each of the variables in your .env file as separate Vars here:

This will override your .env file - so there is not need to remove/edit that file.
