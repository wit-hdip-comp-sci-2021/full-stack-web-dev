# Heroku Node Guide

Visit heroku and create an account:

- <http://www.heroku.com>

You will also need to install the `Heroku CommandLine` on your worksation:

- <https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/command-line>

Make sure these are installed and functioning before proceeding further.

In order to get familiar with the heroku workflow, you may benefit from working through one of the getting started guides:

- <https://devcenter.heroku.com/start>

In particular, the node.js guide:

- <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction>

However, this lab should be all you need to get started.
