# Exercise

This is the Playtime application at the end if this lab:

- [playtime-0.11.0.zip](archives/playtime-0.11.0.zip)

### Exercise 1:

We have a delete image function in the imageStore object:

~~~javascript
  deleteImage: async function(img) {
    await cloudinary.v2.uploader.destroy(img, {});
  }
~~~

Introduce a facility on the playlist view to remove a playlist image (if there is one).
