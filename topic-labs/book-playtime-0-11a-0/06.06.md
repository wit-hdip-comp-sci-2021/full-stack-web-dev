# Test Application Connection

Back in our Playtime application, we already have a .env file:

```bash
cookie_name=playtime
cookie_password=secretpasswordnotrevealedtoanyone
# db=mongodb://localhost/donation
db=mongodb+srv://playtime:playtime@cluster0.rhZZZmAA4m.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

In the above we have commented out the local version of the database, in included the connection string to our Cloud Atlas DB.

Restart the application, and verify that it connects successfully:

```bash
Server running at: http://localhost:3000
database connected to playtime on cluster0-shard-00-00.rhm4m.mongodb.net
```

Verify that you can operate the application. Check Robo 3T that the database is updating as expected.

## .env & github

If your application is on a public github repo, you will want to avoid committing the above changes to .env (with the new database access string), as this will enable access to whoever can copy the string.
